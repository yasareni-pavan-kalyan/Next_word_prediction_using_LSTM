       "' his eyes she eclipses\\nand predominates the whole of her sex. it was not that he felt\\nany emotion akin to love for irene adler. all emotions, and that\\none particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but\\nadmirably balanced mind. he was, i take it, the most perfect\\nreasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a\\nlover he would have placed himself in a false position. he never\\nspoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. they\\nwere admirable things for the observer--excellent for drawing the\\nveil from men\\'s motives and actions. but for the trained reasoner\\nto admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely\\nadjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which\\nmight throw a doubt upon all his mental results. grit in a\\nsensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power\\nlenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a\\nnature such as his. and yet there was but one woman to him, and\\nthat woman was the late irene adler, of dubious and questionable\\nmemory.\\n\\ni had seen little of holmes lately. my marriage had drifted us\\naway from each other. my own complete happiness, and the\\nhome-centred interests which rise up around the man who first\\nfinds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to\\nabsorb all my attention, while holmes, who loathed every form of\\nsociety with his whole bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in\\nbaker street, buried among his old books, and alternating from\\nweek to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the\\ndrug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. he was still,\\nas ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his\\nimmense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in\\nfollowing out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which\\nhad been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. from time\\nto time i heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons\\nto odessa in the case of the trepoff murder, of his clearing up\\nof the singular tragedy of the atkinson brothers at trincomalee,\\nand finally of the mission which he had accomplished so\\ndelicately and successfully for the reigning family of holland.\\nbeyond these signs of his activity, however, which i merely\\nshared with all the readers of the daily press, i knew little of\\nmy former friend and companion.\\n\\none night--it was on the twentieth of march, 1888--i was\\nreturning from a journey to a patient (for i had now returned to\\ncivil practice), when my way led me through baker street. as i\\npassed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated\\nin my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the\\nstudy in scarlet, i was seized with a keen desire to see holmes\\nagain, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers.\\nhis rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as i looked up, i saw\\nhis tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against\\nthe blind. he was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head\\nsunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. to me, who\\nknew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their\\nown story. he was at work again. he had risen out of his\\ndrug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new\\nproblem. i rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which\\nhad formerly been in part my own.\\n\\nhis manner was not effusive. it seldom was; but he was glad, i\\nthink, to see me. with hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly\\neye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars,\\nand indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. then he\\nstood before the fire and looked me over in his singular\\nintrospective fashion.\\n\\n\"wedlock suits you,\" he remarked. \"i think, watson, that you have\\nput on seven and a half pounds since i saw you.\"\\n\\n\"seven!\" i answered.\\n\\n\"indeed, i should have thought a little more. just a trifle more,\\ni fancy, watson. and in practice again, i observe. you did not\\ntell me that you intended to go into harness.\"\\n\\n\"then, how do you know?\"\\n\\n\"i see it, i deduce it. how do i know that you have been getting\\nyourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and\\ncareless servant girl?\"\\n\\n\"my dear holmes,\" said i, \"this is too much. you would certainly\\nhave been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. it is true\\nthat i had a country walk on thursday and came home in a dreadful\\nmess, but as i have changed my clothes i can\\'t imagine how you\\ndeduce it. as to mary jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has\\ngiven her notice, but there, again, i fail to see how you work it\\nout.\"\\n\\nhe chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands\\ntogether.\\n\\n\"it is simplicity itself,\" said he; \"my eyes tell me that on the\\ninside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it,\\nthe leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. obviously they\\nhave been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round\\nthe edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it.\\nhence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile\\nweather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting\\nspecimen of the london slavey. as to your practice, if a\\ngentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black\\nmark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge\\non the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted\\nhis stethoscope, i must be dull, indeed, if i do not pronounce\\nhim to be an active member of the medical profession.\"\\n\\ni could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his\\nprocess of deduction. \"when i hear you give your reasons,\" i\\nremarked, \"the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously\\nsimple that i could easily do it myself, though at each\\nsuccessive instance of your reasoning i am baffled until you\\nexplain your process. and yet i believe that my eyes are as good\\nas yours.\"\\n\\n\"quite so,\" he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing\\nhimself down into an armchair. \"you see, but you do not observe.\\nthe distinction is clear. for example, you have frequently seen\\nthe steps which lead up from the hall to this room.\"\\n\\n\"frequently.\"\\n\\n\"how often?\"\\n\\n\"well, some hundreds of times.\"\\n\\n\"then how many are there?\"\\n\\n\"how many? i don\\'t know.\"\\n\\n\"quite so! you have not observed. and yet you have seen. that is\\njust my point. now, i know that there are seventeen steps,\\nbecause i have both seen and observed. by-the-way, since you are\\ninterested in these little problems, and since you are good\\nenough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you\\nmay be interested in this.\" he threw over a sheet of thick,\\npink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open upon the table.\\n\"it came by the last post,\" said he. \"read it aloud.\"\\n\\nthe note was undated, and without either signature or address.\\n\\n\"there will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight\\no\\'clock,\" it said, \"a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a\\nmatter of the very deepest moment. your recent services to one of\\nthe royal houses of europe have shown that you are one who may\\nsafely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which\\ncan hardly be exaggerated. this account of you we have from all\\nquarters received. be in your chamber then at that hour, and do\\nnot take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.\"\\n\\n\"this is indeed a mystery,\" i remarked. \"what do you imagine that\\nit means?\"\\n\\n\"i have no data yet. it is a capital mistake to theorize before\\none has data. insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit\\ntheories, instead of theories to suit facts. but the note itself.\\nwhat do you deduce from it?\"\\n\\ni carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was\\nwritten.\\n\\n\"the man who wrote it was presumably well to do,\" i remarked,\\nendeavouring to imitate my companion\\'s processes. \"such paper\\ncould not be bought under half a crown a packet. it is peculiarly\\nstrong and stiff.\"\\n\\n\"peculiar--that is the very word,\" said holmes. \"it is not an\\nenglish paper at all. hold it up to the light.\"\\n\\ni did so, and saw a large \"e\" with a small \"g,\" a \"p,\" and a\\nlarge \"g\" with a small \"t\" woven into the texture of the paper.\\n\\n\"what do you make of that?\" asked holmes.\\n\\n\"the name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.\"\\n\\n\"not at all. the \\'g\\' with the small \\'t\\' stands for\\n\\'gesellschaft,\\' which is the german for \\'company.\\' it is a\\ncustomary contraction like our \\'co.\\' \\'p,\\' of course, stands for\\n\\'papier.\\' now for the \\'eg.\\' let us glance at our continental\\ngazetteer.\" he took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves.\\n\"eglow, eglonitz--here we are, egria. it is in a german-speaking\\ncountry--in bohemia, not far from carlsbad. \\'remarkable as being\\nthe scene of the death of wallenstein, and for its numerous\\nglass-factories and paper-mills.\\' ha, ha, my boy, what do you\\nmake of that?\" his eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue\\ntriumphant cloud from his cigarette.\\n\\n\"the paper was made in bohemia,\" i said.\\n\\n\"precisely. and the man who wrote the note is a german. do you\\nnote the peculiar construction of the sentence--\\'this account of\\nyou we have from all quarters received.\\' a frenchman or russian\\ncould not have written that. it is the german who is so\\nuncourteous to his verbs. it only remains, therefore, to discover\\nwhat is wanted by this german who writes upon bohemian paper and\\nprefers wearing a mask to showing his face. and here he comes, if\\ni am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts.\"\\n\\nas he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses\\' hoofs and\\ngrating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the\\nbell. holmes whistled.\\n\\n\"a pair, by the sound,\" said he. \"yes,\" he continued, glancing\\nout of the window. \"a nice little brougham and a pair of\\nbeauties. a hundred and fifty guineas apiece. there\\'s money in\\nthis case, watson, if there is nothing else.\"\\n\\n\"i think that i had better go, holmes.\"\\n\\n\"not a bit, doctor. stay where you are. i am lost without my\\nboswell. and this promises to be interesting. it would be a pity\\nto miss it.\"\\n\\n\"but your client--\"\\n\\n\"never mind him. i may want your help, and so may he. here he\\ncomes. sit down in that armchair, doctor, and give us your best\\nattention.\"\\n\\na slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and\\nin the passage, paused immediately outside the door. then there\\nwas a loud and authoritative tap.\\n\\n\"come in!\" said holmes.\\n\\na man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six\\ninches in height, with the chest and limbs of a hercules. his\\ndress was rich with a richness which would, in england, be looked\\nupon as akin to bad taste. heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed\\nacross the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while\\nthe deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined\\nwith flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch\\nwhich consisted of a single flaming beryl. boots which extended\\nhalfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with\\nrich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence\\nwhich was suggested by his whole appearance. he carried a\\nbroad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper\\npart of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black\\nvizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment,\\nfor his hand was still raised to it as he entered. from the lower\\npart of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character,\\nwith a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive\\nof resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.\\n\\n\"you had my note?\" he asked with a deep harsh voice and a\\nstrongly marked german accent. \"i told you that i would call.\" he\\nlooked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to\\naddress.\\n\\n\"pray take a seat,\" said holmes. \"this is my friend and\\ncolleague, dr. watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me\\nin my cases. whom have i the honour to address?\"\\n\\n\"you may address me as the count von kramm, a bohemian nobleman.\\ni understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour\\nand discretion, whom i may trust with a matter of the most\\nextreme importance. if not, i should much prefer to communicate\\nwith you alone.\"\\n\\ni rose to go, but holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me\\nback into my chair. \"it is both, or none,\" said he. \"you may say\\nbefore this gentleman anything which you may say to me.\"\\n\\nthe count shrugged his broad shoulders. \"then i must begin,\" said\\nhe, \"by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at\\nthe end of that time the matter will be of no importance. at\\npresent it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it\\nmay have an influence upon european history.\"\\n\\n\"i promise,\" said holmes.\\n\\n\"and i.\"\\n\\n\"you will excuse this mask,\" continued our strange visitor. \"the\\naugust person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to\\nyou, and i may confess at once that the title by which i have\\njust called myself is not exactly my own.\"\\n\\n\"i was aware of it,\" said holmes dryly.\\n\\n\"the circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution\\nhas to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense\\nscandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of\\neurope. to speak plainly, the matter implicates the great house\\nof ormstein, hereditary kings of bohemia.\"\\n\\n\"i was also aware of that,\" murmured holmes, settling himself\\ndown in his armchair and closing his eyes.\\n\\nour visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,\\nlounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him\\nas the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in europe.\\nholmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his\\ngigantic client.\\n\\n\"if your majesty would condescend to state your case,\" he\\nremarked, \"i should be better able to advise you.\"\\n\\nthe man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in\\nuncontrollable agitation. then, with a gesture of desperation, he\\ntore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. \"you\\nare right,\" he cried; \"i am the king. why should i attempt to\\nconceal it?\"\\n\\n\"why, indeed?\" murmured holmes. \"your majesty had not spoken\\nbefore i was aware that i was addressing wilhelm gottsreich\\nsigismond von ormstein, grand duke of cassel-felstein, and\\nhereditary king of bohemia.\"\\n\\n\"but you can understand,\" said our strange visitor, sitting down\\nonce more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, \"you\\ncan understand that i am not accustomed to doing such business in\\nmy own person. yet the matter was so delicate that i could not\\nconfide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. i\\nhave come incognito from prague for the purpose of consulting\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\"then, pray consult,\" said holmes, shutting his eyes once more.\\n\\n\"the facts are briefly these: some five years ago, during a\\nlengthy visit to warsaw, i made the acquaintance of the well-known\\nadventuress, irene adler. the name is no doubt familiar to you.\"\\n\\n\"kindly look her up in my index, doctor,\" murmured holmes without\\nopening his eyes. for many years he had adopted a system of\\ndocketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it\\nwas difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not\\nat once furnish information. in this case i found her biography\\nsandwiched in between that of a hebrew rabbi and that of a\\nstaff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea\\nfishes.\\n\\n\"let me see!\" said holmes. \"hum! born in new jersey in the year\\n1858. contralto--hum! la scala, hum! prima donna imperial opera\\nof warsaw--yes! retired from operatic stage--ha! living in\\nlondon--quite so! your majesty, as i understand, became entangled\\nwith this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and\\nis now desirous of getting those letters back.\"\\n\\n\"precisely so. but how--\"\\n\\n\"was there a secret marriage?\"\\n\\n\"none.\"\\n\\n\"no legal papers or certificates?\"\\n\\n\"none.\"\\n\\n\"then i fail to follow your majesty. if this young person should\\nproduce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is\\nshe to prove their authenticity?\"\\n\\n\"there is the writing.\"\\n\\n\"pooh, pooh! forgery.\"\\n\\n\"my private note-paper.\"\\n\\n\"stolen.\"\\n\\n\"my own seal.\"\\n\\n\"imitated.\"\\n\\n\"my photograph.\"\\n\\n\"bought.\"\\n\\n\"we were both in the photograph.\"\\n\\n\"oh, dear! that is very bad! your majesty has indeed committed an\\nindiscretion.\"\\n\\n\"i was mad--insane.\"\\n\\n\"you have compromised yourself seriously.\"\\n\\n\"i was only crown prince then. i was young. i am but thirty now.\"\\n\\n\"it must be recovered.\"\\n\\n\"we have tried and failed.\"\\n\\n\"your majesty must pay. it must be bought.\"\\n\\n\"she will not sell.\"\\n\\n\"stolen, then.\"\\n\\n\"five attempts have been made. twice burglars in my pay ransacked\\nher house. once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. twice\\nshe has been waylaid. there has been no result.\"\\n\\n\"no sign of it?\"\\n\\n\"absolutely none.\"\\n\\nholmes laughed. \"it is quite a pretty little problem,\" said he.\\n\\n\"but a very serious one to me,\" returned the king reproachfully.\\n\\n\"very, indeed. and what does she propose to do with the\\nphotograph?\"\\n\\n\"to ruin me.\"\\n\\n\"but how?\"\\n\\n\"i am about to be married.\"\\n\\n\"so i have heard.\"\\n\\n\"to clotilde lothman von saxe-meningen, second daughter of the\\nking of scandinavia. you may know the strict principles of her\\nfamily. she is herself the very soul of delicacy. a shadow of a\\ndoubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end.\"\\n\\n\"and irene adler?\"\\n\\n\"threatens to send them the photograph. and she will do it. i\\nknow that she will do it. you do not know her, but she has a soul\\nof steel. she has the face of the most beautiful of women, and\\nthe mind of the most resolute of men. rather than i should marry\\nanother woman, there are no lengths to which she would not\\ngo--none.\"\\n\\n\"you are sure that she has not sent it yet?\"\\n\\n\"i am sure.\"\\n\\n\"and why?\"\\n\\n\"because she has said that she would send it on the day when the\\nbetrothal was publicly proclaimed. that will be next monday.\"\\n\\n\"oh, then we have three days yet,\" said holmes with a yawn. \"that\\nis very fortunate, as i have one or two matters of importance to\\nlook into just at present. your majesty will, of course, stay in\\nlondon for the present?\"\\n\\n\"certainly. you will find me at the langham under the name of the\\ncount von kramm.\"\\n\\n\"then i shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.\"\\n\\n\"pray do so. i shall be all anxiety.\"\\n\\n\"then, as to money?\"\\n\\n\"you have carte blanche.\"\\n\\n\"absolutely?\"\\n\\n\"i tell you that i would give one of the provinces of my kingdom\\nto have that photograph.\"\\n\\n\"and for present expenses?\"\\n\\nthe king took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak\\nand laid it on the table.\\n\\n\"there are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in\\nnotes,\" he said.\\n\\nholmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and\\nhanded it to him.\\n\\n\"and mademoiselle\\'s address?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"is briony lodge, serpentine avenue, st. john\\'s wood.\"\\n\\nholmes took a note of it. \"one other question,\" said he. \"was the\\nphotograph a cabinet?\"\\n\\n\"it was.\"\\n\\n\"then, good-night, your majesty, and i trust that we shall soon\\nhave some good news for you. and good-night, watson,\" he added,\\nas the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. \"if\\nyou will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three\\no\\'clock i should like to chat this little matter over with you.\"\\n\\n\\nii.\\n\\nat three o\\'clock precisely i was at baker street, but holmes had\\nnot yet returned. the landlady informed me that he had left the\\nhouse shortly after eight o\\'clock in the morning. i sat down\\nbeside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him,\\nhowever long he might be. i was already deeply interested in his\\ninquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and\\nstrange features which were associated with the two crimes which\\ni have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the\\nexalted station of his client gave it a character of its own.\\nindeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my\\nfriend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of\\na situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a\\npleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the\\nquick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most\\ninextricable mysteries. so accustomed was i to his invariable\\nsuccess that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to\\nenter into my head.\\n\\nit was close upon four before the door opened, and a\\ndrunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an\\ninflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room.\\naccustomed as i was to my friend\\'s amazing powers in the use of\\ndisguises, i had to look three times before i was certain that it\\nwas indeed he. with a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he\\nemerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old.\\nputting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in\\nfront of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.\\n\\n\"well, really!\" he cried, and then he choked and laughed again\\nuntil he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the\\nchair.\\n\\n\"what is it?\"\\n\\n\"it\\'s quite too funny. i am sure you could never guess how i\\nemployed my morning, or what i ended by doing.\"\\n\\n\"i can\\'t imagine. i suppose that you have been watching the\\nhabits, and perhaps the house, of miss irene adler.\"\\n\\n\"quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. i will tell you,\\nhowever. i left the house a little after eight o\\'clock this\\nmorning in the character of a groom out of work. there is a\\nwonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. be one of\\nthem, and you will know all that there is to know. i soon found\\nbriony lodge. it is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but\\nbuilt out in front right up to the road, two stories. chubb lock\\nto the door. large sitting-room on the right side, well\\nfurnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those\\npreposterous english window fasteners which a child could open.\\nbehind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window\\ncould be reached from the top of the coach-house. i walked round\\nit and examined it closely from every point of view, but without\\nnoting anything else of interest.\\n\\n\"i then lounged down the street and found, as i expected, that\\nthere was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the\\ngarden. i lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses,\\nand received in exchange twopence, a glass of half and half, two\\nfills of shag tobacco, and as much information as i could desire\\nabout miss adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in\\nthe neighbourhood in whom i was not in the least interested, but\\nwhose biographies i was compelled to listen to.\"\\n\\n\"and what of irene adler?\" i asked.\\n\\n\"oh, she has turned all the men\\'s heads down in that part. she is\\nthe daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. so say the\\nserpentine-mews, to a man. she lives quietly, sings at concerts,\\ndrives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for\\ndinner. seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings.\\nhas only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. he is dark,\\nhandsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and\\noften twice. he is a mr. godfrey norton, of the inner temple. see\\nthe advantages of a cabman as a confidant. they had driven him\\nhome a dozen times from serpentine-mews, and knew all about him.\\nwhen i had listened to all they had to tell, i began to walk up\\nand down near briony lodge once more, and to think over my plan\\nof campaign.\\n\\n\"this godfrey norton was evidently an important factor in the\\nmatter. he was a lawyer. that sounded ominous. what was the\\nrelation between them, and what the object of his repeated\\nvisits? was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? if the\\nformer, she had probably transferred the photograph to his\\nkeeping. if the latter, it was less likely. on the issue of this\\nquestion depended whether i should continue my work at briony\\nlodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman\\'s chambers in the\\ntemple. it was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my\\ninquiry. i fear that i bore you with these details, but i have to\\nlet you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the\\nsituation.\"\\n\\n\"i am following you closely,\" i answered.\\n\\n\"i was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab\\ndrove up to briony lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. he was a\\nremarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached--evidently\\nthe man of whom i had heard. he appeared to be in a\\ngreat hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the\\nmaid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly\\nat home.\\n\\n\"he was in the house about half an hour, and i could catch\\nglimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and\\ndown, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. of her i could see\\nnothing. presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than\\nbefore. as he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from\\nhis pocket and looked at it earnestly, \\'drive like the devil,\\' he\\nshouted, \\'first to gross & hankey\\'s in regent street, and then to\\nthe church of st. monica in the edgeware road. half a guinea if\\nyou do it in twenty minutes!\\'\\n\\n\"away they went, and i was just wondering whether i should not do\\nwell to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau,\\nthe coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under\\nhis ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of\\nthe buckles. it hadn\\'t pulled up before she shot out of the hall\\ndoor and into it. i only caught a glimpse of her at the moment,\\nbut she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.\\n\\n\"\\'the church of st. monica, john,\\' she cried, \\'and half a\\nsovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.\\'\\n\\n\"this was quite too good to lose, watson. i was just balancing\\nwhether i should run for it, or whether i should perch behind her\\nlandau when a cab came through the street. the driver looked\\ntwice at such a shabby fare, but i jumped in before he could\\nobject. \\'the church of st. monica,\\' said i, \\'and half a sovereign\\nif you reach it in twenty minutes.\\' it was twenty-five minutes to\\ntwelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.\\n\\n\"my cabby drove fast. i don\\'t think i ever drove faster, but the\\nothers were there before us. the cab and the landau with their\\nsteaming horses were in front of the door when i arrived. i paid\\nthe man and hurried into the church. there was not a soul there\\nsave the two whom i had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who\\nseemed to be expostulating with them. they were all three\\nstanding in a knot in front of the altar. i lounged up the side\\naisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church.\\nsuddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to\\nme, and godfrey norton came running as hard as he could towards\\nme.\\n\\n\"\\'thank god,\\' he cried. \\'you\\'ll do. come! come!\\'\\n\\n\"\\'what then?\\' i asked.\\n\\n\"\\'come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won\\'t be legal.\\'\\n\\n\"i was half-dragged up to the altar, and before i knew where i was\\ni found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear,\\nand vouching for things of which i knew nothing, and generally\\nassisting in the secure tying up of irene adler, spinster, to\\ngodfrey norton, bachelor. it was all done in an instant, and\\nthere was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady\\non the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. it was\\nthe most preposterous position in which i ever found myself in my\\nlife, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just\\nnow. it seems that there had been some informality about their\\nlicense, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them\\nwithout a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance\\nsaved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in\\nsearch of a best man. the bride gave me a sovereign, and i mean\\nto wear it on my watch-chain in memory of the occasion.\"\\n\\n\"this is a very unexpected turn of affairs,\" said i; \"and what\\nthen?\"\\n\\n\"well, i found my plans very seriously menaced. it looked as if\\nthe pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate\\nvery prompt and energetic measures on my part. at the church\\ndoor, however, they separated, he driving back to the temple, and\\nshe to her own house. \\'i shall drive out in the park at five as\\nusual,\\' she said as she left him. i heard no more. they drove\\naway in different directions, and i went off to make my own\\narrangements.\"\\n\\n\"which are?\"\\n\\n\"some cold beef and a glass of beer,\" he answered, ringing the\\nbell. \"i have been too busy to think of food, and i am likely to\\nbe busier still this evening. by the way, doctor, i shall want\\nyour co-operation.\"\\n\\n\"i shall be delighted.\"\\n\\n\"you don\\'t mind breaking the law?\"\\n\\n\"not in the least.\"\\n\\n\"nor running a chance of arrest?\"\\n\\n\"not in a good cause.\"\\n\\n\"oh, the cause is excellent!\"\\n\\n\"then i am your man.\"\\n\\n\"i was sure that i might rely on you.\"\\n\\n\"but what is it you wish?\"\\n\\n\"when mrs. turner has brought in the tray i will make it clear to\\nyou. now,\" he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that\\nour landlady had provided, \"i must discuss it while i eat, for i\\nhave not much time. it is nearly five now. in two hours we must\\nbe on the scene of action. miss irene, or madame, rather, returns\\nfrom her drive at seven. we must be at briony lodge to meet her.\"\\n\\n\"and what then?\"\\n\\n\"you must leave that to me. i have already arranged what is to\\noccur. there is only one point on which i must insist. you must\\nnot interfere, come what may. you understand?\"\\n\\n\"i am to be neutral?\"\\n\\n\"to do nothing whatever. there will probably be some small\\nunpleasantness. do not join in it. it will end in my being\\nconveyed into the house. four or five minutes afterwards the\\nsitting-room window will open. you are to station yourself close\\nto that open window.\"\\n\\n\"yes.\"\\n\\n\"you are to watch me, for i will be visible to you.\"\\n\\n\"yes.\"\\n\\n\"and when i raise my hand--so--you will throw into the room what\\ni give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of\\nfire. you quite follow me?\"\\n\\n\"entirely.\"\\n\\n\"it is nothing very formidable,\" he said, taking a long cigar-shaped\\nroll from his pocket. \"it is an ordinary plumber\\'s smoke-rocket,\\nfitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting.\\nyour task is confined to that. when you raise your cry of fire,\\nit will be taken up by quite a number of people. you may then\\nwalk to the end of the street, and i will rejoin you in ten\\nminutes. i hope that i have made myself clear?\"\\n\\n\"i am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you,\\nand at the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry\\nof fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street.\"\\n\\n\"precisely.\"\\n\\n\"then you may entirely rely on me.\"\\n\\n\"that is excellent. i think, perhaps, it is almost time that i\\nprepare for the new role i have to play.\"\\n\\nhe disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in\\nthe character of an amiable and simple-minded nonconformist\\nclergyman. his broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white\\ntie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and\\nbenevolent curiosity were such as mr. john hare alone could have\\nequalled. it was not merely that holmes changed his costume. his\\nexpression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every\\nfresh part that he assumed. the stage lost a fine actor, even as\\nscience lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in\\ncrime.\\n\\nit was a quarter past six when we left baker street, and it still\\nwanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in\\nserpentine avenue. it was already dusk, and the lamps were just\\nbeing lighted as we paced up and down in front of briony lodge,\\nwaiting for the coming of its occupant. the house was just such\\nas i had pictured it from sherlock holmes\\' succinct description,\\nbut the locality appeared to be less private than i expected. on\\nthe contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was\\nremarkably animated. there was a group of shabbily dressed men\\nsmoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his\\nwheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and\\nseveral well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with\\ncigars in their mouths.\\n\\n\"you see,\" remarked holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of\\nthe house, \"this marriage rather simplifies matters. the\\nphotograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. the chances are\\nthat she would be as averse to its being seen by mr. godfrey\\nnorton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his\\nprincess. now the question is, where are we to find the\\nphotograph?\"\\n\\n\"where, indeed?\"\\n\\n\"it is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. it is\\ncabinet size. too large for easy concealment about a woman\\'s\\ndress. she knows that the king is capable of having her waylaid\\nand searched. two attempts of the sort have already been made. we\\nmay take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her.\"\\n\\n\"where, then?\"\\n\\n\"her banker or her lawyer. there is that double possibility. but\\ni am inclined to think neither. women are naturally secretive,\\nand they like to do their own secreting. why should she hand it\\nover to anyone else? she could trust her own guardianship, but\\nshe could not tell what indirect or political influence might be\\nbrought to bear upon a business man. besides, remember that she\\nhad resolved to use it within a few days. it must be where she\\ncan lay her hands upon it. it must be in her own house.\"\\n\\n\"but it has twice been burgled.\"\\n\\n\"pshaw! they did not know how to look.\"\\n\\n\"but how will you look?\"\\n\\n\"i will not look.\"\\n\\n\"what then?\"\\n\\n\"i will get her to show me.\"\\n\\n\"but she will refuse.\"\\n\\n\"she will not be able to. but i hear the rumble of wheels. it is\\nher carriage. now carry out my orders to the letter.\"\\n\\nas he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of a carriage came round\\nthe curve of the avenue. it was a smart little landau which\\nrattled up to the door of briony lodge. as it pulled up, one of\\nthe loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in\\nthe hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another\\nloafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. a fierce\\nquarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who\\ntook sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder,\\nwho was equally hot upon the other side. a blow was struck, and\\nin an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was\\nthe centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who\\nstruck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. holmes\\ndashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but just as he reached\\nher he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood\\nrunning freely down his face. at his fall the guardsmen took to\\ntheir heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while\\na number of better-dressed people, who had watched the scuffle\\nwithout taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to\\nattend to the injured man. irene adler, as i will still call her,\\nhad hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her\\nsuperb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking\\nback into the street.\\n\\n\"is the poor gentleman much hurt?\" she asked.\\n\\n\"he is dead,\" cried several voices.\\n\\n\"no, no, there\\'s life in him!\" shouted another. \"but he\\'ll be\\ngone before you can get him to hospital.\"\\n\\n\"he\\'s a brave fellow,\" said a woman. \"they would have had the\\nlady\\'s purse and watch if it hadn\\'t been for him. they were a\\ngang, and a rough one, too. ah, he\\'s breathing now.\"\\n\\n\"he can\\'t lie in the street. may we bring him in, marm?\"\\n\\n\"surely. bring him into the sitting-room. there is a comfortable\\nsofa. this way, please!\"\\n\\nslowly and solemnly he was borne into briony lodge and laid out\\nin the principal room, while i still observed the proceedings\\nfrom my post by the window. the lamps had been lit, but the\\nblinds had not been drawn, so that i could see holmes as he lay\\nupon the couch. i do not know whether he was seized with\\ncompunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but i\\nknow that i never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life\\nthan when i saw the beautiful creature against whom i was\\nconspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited\\nupon the injured man. and yet it would be the blackest treachery\\nto holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted\\nto me. i hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under\\nmy ulster. after all, i thought, we are not injuring her. we are\\nbut preventing her from injuring another.\\n\\nholmes had sat up upon the couch, and i saw him motion like a man\\nwho is in need of air. a maid rushed across and threw open the\\nwindow. at the same instant i saw him raise his hand and at the\\nsignal i tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of \"fire!\" the\\nword was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of\\nspectators, well dressed and ill--gentlemen, ostlers, and\\nservant-maids--joined in a general shriek of \"fire!\" thick clouds\\nof smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. i\\ncaught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice\\nof holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm.\\nslipping through the shouting crowd i made my way to the corner\\nof the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my\\nfriend\\'s arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar.\\nhe walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we\\nhad turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the\\nedgeware road.\\n\\n\"you did it very nicely, doctor,\" he remarked. \"nothing could\\nhave been better. it is all right.\"\\n\\n\"you have the photograph?\"\\n\\n\"i know where it is.\"\\n\\n\"and how did you find out?\"\\n\\n\"she showed me, as i told you she would.\"\\n\\n\"i am still in the dark.\"\\n\\n\"i do not wish to make a mystery,\" said he, laughing. \"the matter\\nwas perfectly simple. you, of course, saw that everyone in the\\nstreet was an accomplice. they were all engaged for the evening.\"\\n\\n\"i guessed as much.\"\\n\\n\"then, when the row broke out, i had a little moist red paint in\\nthe palm of my hand. i rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand\\nto my face, and became a piteous spectacle. it is an old trick.\"\\n\\n\"that also i could fathom.\"\\n\\n\"then they carried me in. she was bound to have me in. what else\\ncould she do? and into her sitting-room, which was the very room\\nwhich i suspected. it lay between that and her bedroom, and i was\\ndetermined to see which. they laid me on a couch, i motioned for\\nair, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your\\nchance.\"\\n\\n\"how did that help you?\"\\n\\n\"it was all-important. when a woman thinks that her house is on\\nfire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she\\nvalues most. it is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and i have\\nmore than once taken advantage of it. in the case of the\\ndarlington substitution scandal it was of use to me, and also in\\nthe arnsworth castle business. a married woman grabs at her baby;\\nan unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. now it was clear to\\nme that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious\\nto her than what we are in quest of. she would rush to secure it.\\nthe alarm of fire was admirably done. the smoke and shouting were\\nenough to shake nerves of steel. she responded beautifully. the\\nphotograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the\\nright bell-pull. she was there in an instant, and i caught a\\nglimpse of it as she half-drew it out. when i cried out that it\\nwas a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed\\nfrom the room, and i have not seen her since. i rose, and, making\\nmy excuses, escaped from the house. i hesitated whether to\\nattempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had\\ncome in, and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to\\nwait. a little over-precipitance may ruin all.\"\\n\\n\"and now?\" i asked.\\n\\n\"our quest is practically finished. i shall call with the king\\nto-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. we will be\\nshown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is\\nprobable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the\\nphotograph. it might be a satisfaction to his majesty to regain\\nit with his own hands.\"\\n\\n\"and when will you call?\"\\n\\n\"at eight in the morning. she will not be up, so that we shall\\nhave a clear field. besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage\\nmay mean a complete change in her life and habits. i must wire to\\nthe king without delay.\"\\n\\nwe had reached baker street and had stopped at the door. he was\\nsearching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:\\n\\n\"good-night, mister sherlock holmes.\"\\n\\nthere were several people on the pavement at the time, but the\\ngreeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had\\nhurried by.\\n\\n\"i\\'ve heard that voice before,\" said holmes, staring down the\\ndimly lit street. \"now, i wonder who the deuce that could have\\nbeen.\"\\n\\n\\niii.\\n\\ni slept at baker street that night, and we were engaged upon our\\ntoast and coffee in the morning when the king of bohemia rushed\\ninto the room.\\n\\n\"you have really got it!\" he cried, grasping sherlock holmes by\\neither shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.\\n\\n\"not yet.\"\\n\\n\"but you have hopes?\"\\n\\n\"i have hopes.\"\\n\\n\"then, come. i am all impatience to be gone.\"\\n\\n\"we must have a cab.\"\\n\\n\"no, my brougham is waiting.\"\\n\\n\"then that will simplify matters.\" we descended and started off\\nonce more for briony lodge.\\n\\n\"irene adler is married,\" remarked holmes.\\n\\n\"married! when?\"\\n\\n\"yesterday.\"\\n\\n\"but to whom?\"\\n\\n\"to an english lawyer named norton.\"\\n\\n\"but she could not love him.\"\\n\\n\"i am in hopes that she does.\"\\n\\n\"and why in hopes?\"\\n\\n\"because it would spare your majesty all fear of future\\nannoyance. if the lady loves her husband, she does not love your\\nmajesty. if she does not love your majesty, there is no reason\\nwhy she should interfere with your majesty\\'s plan.\"\\n\\n\"it is true. and yet--well! i wish she had been of my own\\nstation! what a queen she would have made!\" he relapsed into a\\nmoody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in\\nserpentine avenue.\\n\\nthe door of briony lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood\\nupon the steps. she watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped\\nfrom the brougham.\\n\\n\"mr. sherlock holmes, i believe?\" said she.\\n\\n\"i am mr. holmes,\" answered my companion, looking at her with a\\nquestioning and rather startled gaze.\\n\\n\"indeed! my mistress told me that you were likely to call. she\\nleft this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from charing\\ncross for the continent.\"\\n\\n\"what!\" sherlock holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and\\nsurprise. \"do you mean that she has left england?\"\\n\\n\"never to return.\"\\n\\n\"and the papers?\" asked the king hoarsely. \"all is lost.\"\\n\\n\"we shall see.\" he pushed past the servant and rushed into the\\ndrawing-room, followed by the king and myself. the furniture was\\nscattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and\\nopen drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before\\nher flight. holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small\\nsliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a\\nphotograph and a letter. the photograph was of irene adler\\nherself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to\\n\"sherlock holmes, esq. to be left till called for.\" my friend\\ntore it open and we all three read it together. it was dated at\\nmidnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:\\n\\n\"my dear mr. sherlock holmes,--you really did it very well. you\\ntook me in completely. until after the alarm of fire, i had not a\\nsuspicion. but then, when i found how i had betrayed myself, i\\nbegan to think. i had been warned against you months ago. i had\\nbeen told that if the king employed an agent it would certainly\\nbe you. and your address had been given me. yet, with all this,\\nyou made me reveal what you wanted to know. even after i became\\nsuspicious, i found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind\\nold clergyman. but, you know, i have been trained as an actress\\nmyself. male costume is nothing new to me. i often take advantage\\nof the freedom which it gives. i sent john, the coachman, to\\nwatch you, ran up stairs, got into my walking-clothes, as i call\\nthem, and came down just as you departed.\\n\\n\"well, i followed you to your door, and so made sure that i was\\nreally an object of interest to the celebrated mr. sherlock\\nholmes. then i, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and\\nstarted for the temple to see my husband.\\n\\n\"we both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by\\nso formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when\\nyou call to-morrow. as to the photograph, your client may rest in\\npeace. i love and am loved by a better man than he. the king may\\ndo what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly\\nwronged. i keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a\\nweapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might\\ntake in the future. i leave a photograph which he might care to\\npossess; and i remain, dear mr. sherlock holmes,\\n\\n                                      \"very truly yours,\\n                                   \"irene norton, nã©e adler.\"\\n\\n\"what a woman--oh, what a woman!\" cried the king of bohemia, when\\nwe had all three read this epistle. \"did i not tell you how quick\\nand resolute she was? would she not have made an admirable queen?\\nis it not a pity that she was not on my level?\"\\n\\n\"from what i have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a\\nvery different level to your majesty,\" said holmes coldly. \"i am\\nsorry that i have not been able to bring your majesty\\'s business\\nto a more successful conclusion.\"\\n\\n\"on the contrary, my dear sir,\" cried the king; \"nothing could be\\nmore successful. i know that her word is inviolate. the\\nphotograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire.\"\\n\\n\"i am glad to hear your majesty say so.\"\\n\\n\"i am immensely indebted to you. pray tell me in what way i can\\nreward you. this ring--\" he slipped an emerald snake ring from\\nhis finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.\\n\\n\"your majesty has something which i should value even more\\nhighly,\" said holmes.\\n\\n\"you have but to name it.\"\\n\\n\"this photograph!\"\\n\\nthe king stared at him in amazement.\\n\\n\"irene\\'s photograph!\" he cried. \"certainly, if you wish it.\"\\n\\n\"i thank your majesty. then there is no more to be done in the\\nmatter. i have the honour to wish you a very good-morning.\" he\\nbowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the\\nking had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his\\nchambers.\\n\\nand that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom\\nof bohemia, and how the best plans of mr. sherlock holmes were\\nbeaten by a woman\\'s wit. he used to make merry over the\\ncleverness of women, but i have not heard him do it of late. and\\nwhen he speaks of irene adler, or when he refers to her\\nphotograph, it is always under the honourable title of the woman.\\n\\n\\n\\nadventure ii. the red-headed league\\n\\ni had called upon my friend, mr. sherlock holmes, one day in the\\nautumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a\\nvery stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair.\\nwith an apology for my intrusion, i was about to withdraw when\\nholmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door\\nbehind me.\\n\\n\"you could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear\\nwatson,\" he said cordially.\\n\\n\"i was afraid that you were engaged.\"\\n\\n\"so i am. very much so.\"\\n\\n\"then i can wait in the next room.\"\\n\\n\"not at all. this gentleman, mr. wilson, has been my partner and\\nhelper in many of my most successful cases, and i have no\\ndoubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also.\"\\n\\nthe stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of\\ngreeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small\\nfat-encircled eyes.\\n\\n\"try the settee,\" said holmes, relapsing into his armchair and\\nputting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in\\njudicial moods. \"i know, my dear watson, that you share my love\\nof all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum\\nroutine of everyday life. you have shown your relish for it by\\nthe enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you\\nwill excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own\\nlittle adventures.\"\\n\\n\"your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,\" i\\nobserved.\\n\\n\"you will remember that i remarked the other day, just before we\\nwent into the very simple problem presented by miss mary\\nsutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary\\ncombinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more\\ndaring than any effort of the imagination.\"\\n\\n\"a proposition which i took the liberty of doubting.\"\\n\\n\"you did, doctor, but none the less you must come round to my\\nview, for otherwise i shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you\\nuntil your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to\\nbe right. now, mr. jabez wilson here has been good enough to call\\nupon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to\\nbe one of the most singular which i have listened to for some\\ntime. you have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique\\nthings are very often connected not with the larger but with the\\nsmaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room f'"
